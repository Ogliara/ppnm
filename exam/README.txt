NOTE TO SELF: At the end of the project, check if matrix.cs is ever used. If not, remove it.

Project number 7: Adaptive two-dimensional integrator.

Goal: To implement a two-dimensional integrator using my own adaptive one-dimensional integrator along both paths.


							INITIAL PLAN:
Step 1) Bring in matrix.cs and integrator.cs.

Step 2) Figure out how to use the 1D integrator for 2D.

Step 3) Construct the 2D integrator.

Step 4) Debug the hell out of it. Figure out its limits so it can be fixed or reported on.

Step 5) Make a couple of plots to go with it.

Step 6) Write an explanation/overview and a self-evaluation of the project.

Step 7) Make sure it is built and fully accessible, as well as linked in the correct place.
