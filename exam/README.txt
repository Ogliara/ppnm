Project number 7: Least-squares signal declipping.

Goal: Implement least-squares minimization for declipping following the idea in this paper:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/robust/www/Papers/cbar14.pdf


							INITIAL PLAN:
Step 1) Do research on subject and formulate goal.

Step 2) Bring in matrix.cs and other scripts.

Step 3) Construct initial draft.

Step 4) Debug the hell out of it. Figure out its limits so it can be fixed or reported on.

Step 5) Make a couple of plots to go with it.

Step 6) Write an explanation/overview and a self-evaluation of the project.

Step 7) Make sure it is built and fully accessible, as well as linked in the correct place.
