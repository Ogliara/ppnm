A couple of notes:
- Main class arguments (args) can be of any type and made as an array. They can also be declared in the Makefile.
- Dimitri has a lot of code on the website to reference if needed.
- Ask Bard or ChatGPT or similar NNs for help on syntax. It's easier than breaking your back over it.

- A reference type refers to a place in the memory. Classes are references.
- A value type copies the value independently from the previous thing.
